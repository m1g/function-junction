**Kata** - a Japanese word, were originally teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. In programming it is an exercise which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book _The Pragmatic Programmer_, as an homage to the Japanese concept of kata in martial arts. [[cite]](http://bit.ly/2ibWW2B)

## Details

Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://gibhub.com/m1g/function-kata) to your own account.
2. Clone your repository: `git clone function-junction`
3. Change into your project's directory: `cd function-junction`
4. Install the dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
5. Open in Atom: `atom .`
6. Start test runner: `yarn test` or `npm test`
7. Open `src/functions.test.js` and work on functions until tests pass.
8. Commit and push your work to github.

## Normal Mode

- All tests passing
- No linter warnings

## Adventure Mode

- If you used "built-in" JavaScript methods like `String.reverse()` or `Array.max()` to solve these problems, try implementing them from scratch.
- Vice-versa: if you implemented your solutions from scratch, look in the documentation linked below to see if JavaScript has any built-in functions to help solve these problems.

## Additional Resources

Reference the documentation on MDN to find what kind of helpful functions might already be on `Array` and `String` in JavaScript.
